The Coxylib Helios is a javascript library  based on Cardano Smart Contract development language called Helios(https://github.com/HeliosLang/compiler) by Christian Schmitz.  It makes developing dapps very easy by giving vanilla js functions for doing these things : minting tokens/nfts, sending tokens/nfts, sending ada to another wallet address, integrating web3 Cardano to any website(pulling out wallet information address, nfts, ada and tokens).

Dependencies: The library depends on the supplied helios.js, jimba.js(for easy and quick testing) and jquery(also supplied here). Connect Nami, Eternl, Lace and also add more wallets as desired.

Advantages of this Coxylib: 

- easy and quick to integrate website to Cardano blockchain.
- 100% efficient client side code.
- every developer knows how to use javascript and therefore this library helps make any developer develop on Cardano.
- easy to deploy: to test, one has to copy and upload the coxylib folder to a cpanel folder and simple run it by pointing to the index.html. In the index.html given comment out code under addEventListener to test the library.

- Test the library live at https://coxygen.co/coxylib/index.html

- (Connect Nami to preprod network and add 5tADA collateral and have at least 20tAda in order to mint nfts); report issues here.
