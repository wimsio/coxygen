## 1. Introduction & Methodology

This report presents a detailed analysis of the Coxygen Global survey conducted on May 12 2025, evaluating Cardano Live Technical Support and Training Services. 
The approach is both quantitative and qualitative.

## 4. Key Findings

### 4.1 Geographic Distribution

**Figure 1** shows most participants are from **South Africa** (13/24; 54%) and **Nigeria** (7/24; 29%), with **DR Congo** (3/24; 13%) and a new cohort from **Ghana** (1/24; 4%).

### 4.2 Awareness of Service Schedule

**100%** of the respondents are aware that the service runs daily in three timezones (**Figure 2**).

### 4.3 Developer Status. 

This serves to know how many respondents are developers. If there are more developers then it is targetting technical community members because this Coxygen Global service is a 
technical one.

**Figure 3**: 17/24 (71%) identify as developers; 7/24 (29%) are non-developers.

### 4.4 Qualification Levels

**Figure 4**:

* Tertiary/College Student: 7 (29%)
* Other: 6 (25%)
* Post Graduate Degree: 5 (21%)
* Undergraduate Degree: 4 (17%)
* BSc: 1 (4%)
* Undergraduate Diploma: 1 (4%)
  
From the above figures, one can see that opinions in this survey is mostly for students and academic. Other qualifications which we do not know are one quarter.

**Figure 5**: English remains dominant (21/24; 88%), French holds 3/24 (12%).

### 4.6 Preferred Cardano Smart Contract Development Languages

**Figure 6**: Haskell Plutus leads with 18/24 (75%), Helios has 4/24 (17%), and “Other” languages account for 2/24 (8%).

These are very interesting results as previous survey Haskell Plutus/Plinth did not lead with such wide margin.

### 4.7 Cardano Technical Support and Service Satisfaction Ratings

In **Figure 7**, on a 1–5 scale:

* 5 stars: 13 (54%)
* 4 stars: 7 (29%)
* 3 stars: 3 (13%)
* 1 star: 1 (4%)

**Summary Statistics**:

* Mean: **4.29**
* Median: **5.00**
* Standard Deviation: **1.00**

This shows that the majority of respondents are very much satisfied with this service and therefore Coxygen Global should onboard more students and you developers.

### 4.8 Qualitative Feedback

There were 10 open comments (10/24 – responses with text):

They praised practical demos and daily slots, suggested Coxygen must improve the structure and documentation and others expressed continued interest in Cardano collaboration.

## 5. Conclusions & Recommendations

Below are take aways from this short survey:

1. **Sustain high satisfaction**: Coxygen Global continue daily, timezone-aware training.
2. **Broaden reach**: Explore engagement in Ghana and other emerging regions.
3. **Structural enhancements**: Offer clearer agendas, especially for non-developers.
4. **Expanded content**: Introduce “Other” languages/topics based on that minority demand.
5. **Follow up**: Contact participants interested in deeper Cardano collaboration.
