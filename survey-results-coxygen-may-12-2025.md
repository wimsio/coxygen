## 1. Introduction

This report presents a detailed analysis of the Coxygen Global survey conducted on May 12 2025, evaluating Cardano Live Technical Support and Training Services. 
The approach is both quantitative and qualitative.

## 2. Methodology

* **Data Source**: 20 completed responses from a `.tsv` export of the Google Form.
* **Cleaning**: Standardized country names (trimmed whitespace, title-cased).
* **Analysis Tools**: Python (Pandas for data handling; Matplotlib for charts).
* **Sections**: Broken into thematic “Key Findings” with visualizations (Figures 1–7).

## 3. Respondent Overview

* **Total respondents**: 20
* **Missing responses**:

  | Question                | MissingCount |
  | ----------------------- | ------------ |
  | Comments                | 10           |


Half of participants did not provide additional comments.

### 4.8 Qualitative Feedback

Key themes from open-ended comments:

* **High appreciation** for daily training and community support.
