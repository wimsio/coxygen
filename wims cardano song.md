In the cradle of Cardano, we’ve sown a dream,  
CIP-1694 lays the scheme.  
On the road to Voltaire, we take our stand,  
Governance in our hands, across the land.

No central kings, no ruling chains,  
It’s the people’s voice that will sustain,  
A self-sustaining future, so bright and free,  
With ADA, we shape our destiny.

Hydra’s wings, a scaling dream,  
Millions of transactions, like a stream.  
Lightning-fast, low fees to pay,  
Layer 2 leads us to a brighter day.

Scaling the future, opening the door.  
No limits now, the chain will fly,

Cardano stands, unbreakable and sure,  
Proof-of-Stake, the shield that will endure.  
With every node, the system’s tight,  
A fortress built on cryptographic might.

No malicious code will break the chain,  
Security flows like steady rain.  
Through every block and every turn,  
Cardano’s flame will always burn.

From Africa to Argentina's shore,  
Japan to Europe, Cardano’s roar.  
Communities rise, united in heart,  
In every corner, we play our part.

Hope high in Africa’s lands,  
With blockchain dreams in our hands.  
Argentina sings a governance song,  
And Japan, with wisdom, marches strong.
