## 1. Introduction & Methodology

This report presents a detailed analysis of the Coxygen Global survey conducted on May 12 2025, evaluating Cardano Live Technical Support and Training Services.  
The approach is both quantitative and qualitative.

## 2. Key Findings

### 2.1 Geographic Distribution

A very good development with Coxygen Global is growth in French developers.

### 2.2 Awareness of Service Schedule

**94.4%** of the respondents are aware that the service runs daily in three timezones.

### 2.3 Developer Status

This serves to know how many respondents are developers. If there are more developers then it is targeting technical community members because this Coxygen Global service is a technical one.

**Figure 3**: (77.8%) identify as developers.

### 2.4 Qualification Levels

**Figure 4**:

* Tertiary/College Student:  (25%)  
* Other:  (19.4%)  
* Post Graduate Degree:  (25%)  
* Undergraduate Degree:  (22.2%)  

From the above figures, one can see that opinions in this survey is mostly for students and academic.

### 2.5 Spoken Language Preferences

There are two languages chosen: namely English and French. English dominates.

**Figure 5**: English remains dominant (72.2%), French holds (27.8%).

### 2.6 Preferred Cardano Smart Contract Development Languages

**Figure 6**: Haskell Plutus leads with (83.3%), Helios has (11.1%)

These are very interesting results as previous survey Haskell Plutus/Plinth did not lead with such wide margin.

### 2.7 Qualitative Feedback

Here’s a concise synthesis of the main sentiments and takeaways from 22 comments:

* **Gratitude & Appreciation**  
  * Heartfelt thanks to Cardano and Coxygen for the opportunity, time, and skills provided  
  * Many express they’ll “forever appreciate” or are “genuinely excited” about being part of the program

* **Learning & Knowledge Growth**  
  * Plutus/Haskell training is seen as enriching scientific and technical knowledge  
  * Requests for mini-conferences or more bite-sized, interactive learning sessions

* **Clarity & Organization Needs**  
  * A call for more straightforward, well-organized content and registration processes  
  * Better-trained coaches who can clearly explain concepts, especially for designers

* **Desire for Engagement & Opportunity**  
  * Several comments: “I would really like to work with Cardano” or are “developers in making”  
  * Recognition that this program “gives hope to young developers” and paves a path to future roles

* **Strong Endorsements**  
  * Coxygen Global Universities lauded for its practical, focused developer training  
  * Praise for connecting the Cardano community and promoting decentralized‐solution innovation

* **Neutral/No-Comment Responses**  
  * A handful of participants had “None,” “N/A,” or “No comments” to add

Overall, the community values the education and opportunity but wants clearer organization, more interactive formats (e.g., mini-conferences), and stronger coaching to make the learning journey smoother.

## 4. What Would You Love to See Improved?

This is the summary of what respondents would like to see improved:

* **Time & Scheduling**  
  * More consistent lesson timing and better time management  
  * Add \~15 extra minutes to each session  
  * Adjust internship duration and encourage higher daily attendance

* **Instruction & Support**  
  * Clearer, more accessible training materials and customer-support channels  
  * Dedicated, permanent instructors (especially for Haskell/Plutus) rather than self-study  
  * More experienced developers available for mentoring and deeper, long-form walkthroughs

* **Content & Assessment**  
  * Revise and update quiz questions and functionality so they work smoothly  
  * Expand coverage of specific Cardano topics (e.g. “coxygen”) with detailed explanations

* **Communication & User Experience**  
  * Streamline the website/registration process with straightforward guidance  
  * Improve overall UI/UX and resolve connectivity or feature-access issues  
  * Foster better collaboration and clearer, timely communication

* **Community & Growth**  
  * Boost marketing and awareness to increase program participation  
  * Raise the overall level of education through enhanced resources and events

A number of respondents, however, indicated they’re satisfied or had no further suggestions.

## 5. Conclusions & Recommendations

Below are take aways from this short survey:

1. **Sustain high satisfaction**: Coxygen Global continue daily, timezone-aware training.  
2. **Broaden reach**: Explore engagement in Ghana and other emerging regions.  
3. **Structural enhancements**: Offer clearer agendas, especially for non-developers.  
4. **Expanded content**: Introduce “Other” languages/topics based on that minority demand.  
5. **Follow up**: Contact participants interested in deeper Cardano collaboration.
